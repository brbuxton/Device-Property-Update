# Meraki Device Property Update
Sets properties like street address and tags on Meraki devices.

This is a short script to read the sample_bulk_network_creator.csv available from the Bulk network creator on the Meraki
dashboard and update the devices in that csv with new street address, notes, tags, device name and move the map pointer.
